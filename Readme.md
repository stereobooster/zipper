# Zipper

Zipper is a:

- persistent data structure
- means of "navigation" through another data structure with ability to "change" it on the go (without changing the origina structure), similar to [functional optics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-functional-programming/9781788831437/d83ecfbf-6713-450e-9e90-8f02253427bf.xhtml).

Zipper was proposed (invented?) by G'erard Huet in 1997. You can read his original paper - [Functional Pearl. The Zipper](https://www.st.cs.uni-saarland.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-fp/docs/huet-zipper.pdf), 1997.

> Almost every programmer has faced the problem of representing a tree together with a subtree that is the focus of attention, where that focus may move left, right, up or down the tree. The Zipper is Huetâ€™s nifty name for a nifty data structure which fulfills this need. I wish I had known of it when I faced this task, because the solution I came up with was not quite so efficient or elegant as the Zipper.

Initially Huet proposed Zipper as the way to work with trees (specifically in the context of functional programming, where instead of mutations you need to use persistent data structures).

Later Conor McBride realized that idea of the Zipper can be generalized and used other data structures (not just trees). You can read his original paper - [The Derivative of a Regular Type is its Type of One-Hole Contexts](http://strictlypositive.org/diff.pdf), 2009.

And even more he proposed that derivative of type for data structure gives type of the one hole context for the given data structure (e.g. zipper without focus).

## Zipper for Linked List

Let's start with the Zipper for linked list. Linked list is simpler data structure than tree. Here is a type for linked list:

```
List(T) = T * List(T) + 1
```

Here I use algebraic data type notation:

- `List(T)` - parametrised type, in terms of TypeScript it would be `List<T>`
- `A * B` - product type, in terms of TypeScript it could be tupple `[A, B]` or object `{first: A, second: B}`
- `A + B` - sum type, in terms of TypeScript `A | B`
- `1` is a type with one value, in many language this is type which contains single value `null`. In Lisp they use empty tuple for null `()`

Final type of List in TypeScript:

```ts
type List<T> = {
  value: T;
  next: List<T>;
} | null;
```

Derivative of `List(T)` is `List(T) * List(T)`. Which would correspond to left and right context e.g. values before focus and values after focus (or "hole"). So Zipper for linked list would be:

```
ListZipper(T) = List(T) * T * List(T)
```

Or in terms of TypeScript:

```ts
type ListZipper<T> = {
  left: List<T>;
  focus: T;
  right: List<T>;
};
```

We can define two direction for navigation: left and right.

```ts
const left = <T>(zipper: ListZipper<T>): ListZipper<T> => {
  return {
    left: zipper.left.next,
    focus: zipper.left.value,
    right: cons(zipper.focus, zipper.right),
  };
};

const right = <T>(zipper: ListZipper<T>): ListZipper<T> => {
  return {
    left: cons(zipper.focus, zipper.left),
    focus: zipper.right.value,
    right: zipper.right.next,
  };
};
```

## Understnading Zipper - vizualization

I had trouble understanding Zippers. So I decided to do vizualization for the Zipper, to grasp the concept - https://zipper-huet.netlify.app/.

## History

- Implemented linked list and zipper for it
- Implemented vizaulization using `react-archer`
- Implemented narry tree and (Huet's) zipper for it
- Implemented vizualization using Graphviz
- Implemented vizualization for "cycled" tree (detection of loops)
- Implemented parsing with zippers
- Extended "parsing with zippers" with:
  - Kleene star (`Rep`) - tree for it is similar to `Seq`
    - Didn't implemented Kleene plus (`+`) and optional (`?`), because I was lazy instead use `Alt`
  - lexical nodes (`Lex`) - when parsed derivation tree is replaced by single node with matched value
  - ignored nodes (`Ign`) - when parsed derivation tree is replaced by empty string node
- Added DSL for grammar
  - Including `letrec`-like function to handle creation of cycles. OCaml provide this function ability out of the box, for JS I had to do some hacks
- Extended "parsing with zippers" with tree compaction
  - All nodes except terminals and labeleled non-terminal are removed from parse tree
- Implemented "grammar grammar" e.g. grammar to parse BNF-like grammar
- Implemented playground for "parsing with zippers"
  - User can provide grammar and string and use controls to experiment, observe how parsing happens
- Realized that my Narry-tree and Huet zipper implementation is cumbersome
  - I wanted to make it "by the book" e.g. to show that zipper indeed can be implemented as McBride derivtive and that this exact zipper can be used for parsing (with zipper). It indeed works, but it is very hard to maintain this codebase
  - So I chnaged implementation to LCRS tree and zipper which treats LCRS tree as Narry tree (not as binary tree). It is not by the book, but it is easier for me to handle
- Added vizualization of `Mem` for "parsing with zippers".
  - Not very helpfull to be fair
- Added different UI improvements, like
  - Ability to select node to show "legend" e.g. details about node: label, value, top, left, right, etc..
  - Ability to highlight nodes when other controls are hovered - to easily identify which node is related to this control
  - Ability to jump to specific derivation cycle. This makes debuging so much easier I whould have done this earlier
  - Animation between cycles
  - Pink arrows where zipper will move next
- Display compaction (not the same as tree compaction)
  - It removes all duplicate nodes and changes edges to point to de-duped nodes.
    - Node is duplicate if it has the same `originalId`, `start` and `end` and same children (after de-duplication)
  - This is very similar to [Shared Packed Parse Forest](https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/sppf/sppf.html), except this representation doesn't have ambiguation-nodes
    - It hints how to implement transformation of the result to SPPF
  - If it is possible to compact final result, it means that **memoization doesn't fully work**. It memoizes some nodes, but not all of them
    - Which means that either I messed up implementation
    - Or that it works the same in the original paper
  - The compaction algorithm is a total mess
- Added lookahed operators
  - Similar operators exist in [PEG](https://github.com/stereobooster/derp/blob/main/docs/PEG.md) and [Regular Expressions](https://github.com/stereobooster/derp/blob/main/docs/Regular%20expressions%20with%20lookahead.md): `&` - positive, `!` - negative
  - Current algorithm is a mess. Idea is:
    - to mark each zipper with id
    - if there is lookahead operator it produces two independent zippers - one for lookahed and one for main derivation. Connection between them is stored through ids
    - Derivation of zippers continues independently, but if lookahead matched or unmatched, it will preserve or remove main zippers
  - Lookahed with cycle **doesn't** work so far

## Next

- Add tests and fix bugs
- Collect more examples of "interesting grammars"
  - Markdown parser
- I still a bit fuzzy on how exactly `Mem` works. I get general idea, but when I tried to implement PwZ without memoization table I got confused. So probably it makes sense to continue improving vizaulization for `Mem`
  - As soon as I will understand it better I can implement PwZ without memoization table
- I wonder if it is possible to modify PwZ to produce SPPF instead of list of trees
  - Potentially connected to multiple focus zippers
- Better error message should take in account `Ign` and `Lex`

1. Symbol expressed as a property of Node (Expression)
   - Similar to [named capturing group](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group)
2. Kleene plus implemented as `A+ = A A*`. TODO: implement as `Rep` with min, max
3. Optional implemented as `A? = "" | A`. TODO: implement as `Rep` with min, max
4. [Quantifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Quantifier)
   - TODO: implement as `Rep` with min, max
5. Matches any character of length 1. It doesn't match EOF ("")
6. For now implemented as `Tok`.
   - Renage doesn't support multiple ranges, like `[a-zA-Z_]`
7. Implemented as property (`invert`) of the `Tok`
8. `Lexeme` makes parser scanerless.
   - Kind of similar to [capturing group](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Capturing_group)
   - I have doubt about notation. For now I use `lex(x)`. Other options:
     - Separate section?
     - At rule level? `lex: S -> "a";`, `S:lex -> "a";`
     - At symbol level? `S -> lex("a")`, `S -> lex:"a"`
9. Ignored symbols consume input and output empty strings. Useful when tree compaction used (all empty nodes are removed).
   - For now implemented as separate Expression type, but could be as well implemented as property of Node (Expression).
   - Kind of similar to [non-capturing group](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Non-capturing_group)
   - I have doubt about notation. For now I use `ign(x)`. Maybe `~x`?
10. Lookaheads similar to PEG operators
    - There are probably bugs in implementation (especially when lookaheads are recursive)
    - Allows to express some **context-sensitive** grammars, like $a^nb^nc^n$
    - Kind of similar to [lookahead assertion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Lookahead_assertion)
11. End of file matched only if token is empty string (which can appear only in the end of file `str[pos] || ""`). The difference from `Tok` is that after matching it doesn't stop traversing, instead it continues as if it was empty `Seq`
12. Ordered choice operator from PEG simulated with negative lookahead: `A / B = A | !A B`
    - I think I need to use backtracking in order to implement effective ordered choice
13. Intersection. Original Brzozowski paper had this, but when Might proposed PwD he omitted it. But it could be trivially implemented in PwD
    - In PwZ it is a bit more tricky. Should work the same as `Alt` except it matches only if all branches match
    - Other formalism that proposed to use intersection is [conjuctive grammar](https://github.com/stereobooster/derp/blob/main/docs/Conjunctive%20grammar.md)
    - Allows to express some **context-sensitive** grammars, like $a^nb^nc^n$
    - I think Kozen propoved that it is sound (Î¼-recursive or something like that, need to look up exact mathemtical term)
14. Negation makes sense for matching (negation of character, complement of a language, negative lookahead), but not for parsing. Which tree you suppose to return? As an alternative it is an option to use symbolic nagation:
    - $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$
    - $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$
    - $(A \cdot B)^c = A^c \cdot B \cup A \cdot B^c \cup A^c \cdot B^c$ - this is not quite correct, but we need to start somewhere
    - Original Brzozowski paper had this, but it is not possible to use with recursion (not Î¼-recursive or something like that, need to look up exact mathemtical term). I saw a papper where they proposed how it can be used based on different semantics

### Small bugs and unsorted notes

- add min, max to `Rep` and use it to express different quantifiers
  - `*` min: 0, max: inf
  - `+` min: 1, max: inf
  - `?` min: 0, max: 1
  - `{n,m}` min: n, max: m
  - `{n,}` min: n, max: inf
  - `{n}` min: n, max: n
- BUG: `N -> "a";` can't detect end of the derivation
- Mem visualization
  - draw mem for selected node?
  - draw `m-results`?
  - draw `m-parents` full?
  - add ability to collapse graph by click on node
    - show mem graph (collapsed by default)
    - Collapse `lex` nodes on click
    - Semi-transparent `ign` nodes
- Jump over "borring" steps (1 step, zipper didn't move)
- Next zipper movement vizualisation
  - it is sometimes not obvious why next move will remove zipper, for example, in case when it's loop e.g. the same node was already derived with the given token
- Bug: legend for compacted tree doesn't show info about other (hidden) nodes
- Bug: `A-> "a" "b"; S -> A? A;`, `A -> A "a" | ""; S -> A? A;`
- vizualization
  - highlight all edges and nodes of the selected zipper
  - bug: hover on "next step button" doesn't highlight active zipper after click
  - hovering on zipper node - highlight button in `Direction and depth`
  - use same colors, shapes, labels for `NodeButton` as for node
  - add "URL state" so that any state of derivative could be shared
  - animation is problematic because zipper changes id of node on movement
